A project analyzing educational attainment across the state of Iowa by county. We want to analyze the relationship between education, population, income, and geographic location. 

This will start by cleaning and exploring the data sets, then visualizing the data with maps by county.
We also want to identify if there is any extent to which there is information to be gained from the geographical location of counties in terms of their education levels.
Are there groupings that arise? Is there any predictive value? 

Iowa has a small number of large cities and many very small counties, so we will also want to see what relationships there are if we only look at small counties.
